# üõ£Ô∏è Traffic-flow-detection-system
This project is a prototype real-time traffic monitoring system that uses an STM32 microcontroller for vehicle counting, data logging, and traffic analysis.


## üìÑ Description
This project implements a prototype real-time traffic monitoring system built on an STM32 microcontroller, designed to provide accurate vehicle flow counting and data logging for intelligent transportation applications.

The prototype uses traffic detection sensors (infrared, ultrasonic, or other suitable types) strategically placed along the road or entry/exit points to detect and count passing vehicles. The STM32 acts as the central processing unit, handling sensor data acquisition, signal processing, and event management in real-time.
